	MY COMMENTS TO THE PROJECT ATTENTION

1. Local connection is active if the corresponding neighbour
 exists and is not dead. Averaging in summing signals from 
 the neighbours is done by dividing the sum on the number of 
 ative neighbours. 

2. Averaging in summing signals to the CO is done by the number
 of alive oscillators (so it is independent of the size of 
 the field). With increasing the number of alive oscillators,
 the strenght of the influence of a particular object on 
 the CO decreases.
